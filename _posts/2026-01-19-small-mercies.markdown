Wavelet spines, parading over glaucous fins;  
beetle-ligatures endorsing yucca skin;  
mushrooms scaling chainsaw-worried spider roots;  
weathervaning dandelion parachutes;  
pollen motley waxing over honeybees;  
lichen dander sidled into granite seams;  
lithic testimonies, percolation-leached;  
spirit-exhalations from suspended yeast.
