A pantomime of embryonic stars  
reconstituted; cheesecloth exhalations;  
misguided cauliflower cultivars;  
unsightly alabaster encrustations;  
  
intangibly-congealing perspiration;  
purple, retractile viscera unsheathed  
across diffracted solar indignations;  
angora undulated from beneath;  
  
cold seafoam, opalescing through a reef—  
cerulean’s matte surface-tension broken  
on coral conjunctivities of teeth;  
susurrus, irretrievably soft-spoken;  
  
Ouroboros’ disaffected fumes;  
Traverse-dimensioned funguses in bloom.
