*And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.*  
—Mark 4:11-12  
  
  
### The Book of John the Baptizer 8:23-27  
  
The bona fide impotent breeder  
Disburses paternity seaward.  
Exilic adoptions’  
Veridic decoction  
Of mercy becomes the bequeather.  
  
  
### The Sufi Sayings of Jesus 6  
  
A vacuous scribal redactor  
Is sealed with immaculate plaster.  
Latrine without gaskets,  
He's sound as a casket  
To cherish the feculent splatter.  
  
  
### The Sufi Sayings of Jesus 31  
  
A mongrel left dead in the street  
Develops an ominous reek,  
But lately, the skin’s  
Rearranged in a grin:  
The sunlight has whitened its teeth.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 2:21-22  
  
Raw fabric recoils from tatters  
Immersed in inaugural lather,  
And fresh fermentations  
Take petillant patience  
To burst through their moribund bladders.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 4:3-9  
  
Seeds sown by the roadside are eaten,  
On bouldery shallows sunbeaten,  
And sprouts among brambles  
Are bound in the scramble.  
Good soil gives fruit to its season.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 4:26-29  
  
The farmer's incurably artless;  
Persistent through idling darkness,  
Fastidious polling  
And feckless cajoling,  
The kernel pronounces the harvest.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 4:30-33  
  
A minuscule granule of mustard  
Profusely proliferates upwards,  
Where undulant boughs  
Indulgently house  
The shadowy perches of buzzards.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 9:43-49  
  
Your eyes are incitements to scandal;  
Apprehension’s pernicious to handle.  
Consider excision:  
Holistic perdition  
Eschews the demurely dismantled.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 10:25-27  
  
The affluent shamelessly wheedle,  
Supposing beneficence venal.  
It’s comparably facile  
Compressing a camel  
To enter the eye of a needle.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 11:12-14  
  
The nexus of reaper and eaten  
Encroaches on desolate seasons.  
Deficient in figs,  
Deciduous twigs  
Are duly convicted of treason.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 12:1-9  
  
The lessor’s belligerent tenants  
Despise his parleying lieutenants’  
Solicitous offerings  
And slaughter his offspring,  
Incurring superlative penance.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 12:41-44  
  
Parishioners forfeit their coppers,  
But only the dowager pauper  
Resigns without qualms  
Her dwindling bronze;  
Privation enriches the offer.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 13:34-37  
  
The slave emphasizes routine,  
Suspecting that Master’s regime  
Recurs on the morrow,  
At midnight or cockcrow,  
Suspending an indolent dream.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Mark 14:50-52  
  
A rude revelation befell  
The neophyte-turned-infidel  
Who halted kidnapping  
By sloughing his wrappings,  
Absconding swathed au naturel.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 13:24-30  
  
Whose wheat intermingles with tares  
Too intimately to prepare  
Its coming ordeal  
As kindling or meal  
Permits interim laissez-faire.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 13:33  
  
The daintiest morsel of leaven  
Essays its prospective dimensions,  
Conspiring to grow  
While copious dough  
Affords comprehensive infection.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 13:44  
  
Concerning the prospector’s treasure’s  
Procurement from coveted hectares,  
Divesting for now his  
Entire endowment’s  
Quite fetching, in the altogether.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 13:45-46  
  
Peculiar, immaculate pearl,  
My mercantile hagglings are puerile.  
Would that I could marshal  
Inadequate marbles,  
Exchange quintessential for plural.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 13:47-48  
  
Disporting with fishermen’s augury,  
The ocean disgorges a quandary  
In flesh to appraise—  
Debris, or filets?—  
Its ichthyological congeries.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 18:23-34  
  
The slave abrogating the judgments  
He warrants (imploring indulgence)  
While clapping his debtors  
In caviling fetters  
Receives reparation endungeoned.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 20:1-19  
  
The minister’s vineyard-plantation  
Remunerates mean cultivation  
Discounting the measure  
Or merit of effort  
(Disburses rehearsed compensation).  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 21:28-31  
  
The siblings symmetrically differed  
On tilling the lineal vineyard:  
To promise and shirk,  
Or protest but work.  
The filial loyalist dithered.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 22:2-14  
  
If livestock are slain for the banquet  
And invitee turnout is languid,  
Take strangers for guests,  
But give underdressed  
Auditions proscription and anguish.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 24:43

Politely ambiguous snares.  
The pilferer crawls  
Through moldering walls,  
Discovering you unawares.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 25:1-13  
  
The bridegroom repudiates virgins  
Penurious through inadvertence.  
Unhappily, campers  
With oilless lanterns  
Must weather the wedding with merchants.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Matthew 25:14-30  
  
For slaves on appointive allowance,  
Ascendancy hangs in the balance;  
Trustees too equivocal  
To hazard the principal  
Are underperforming their talents.  
  
  
### First Corinthians 3:11-15  
  
An axiomatic foundation  
Facilitates edification;  
Gold, timber and argent  
Reach differently ardent  
Conclusions around conflagration.  
  
  
### First Corinthians 12:21-26  
  
An eye can’t disparage a fist.  
Your disparate parts coexist  
Through frailties made crucial,  
Disgraces enscrupled,  
Voluptuousnesses eclipsed.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 6:48-49  
  
A groundbreaking takes dedication  
Derivative of its substratum,  
Or else the absorbent  
Assemblage treats torrents  
As signals for disembarkation.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 7:41-43  
  
Remissions are morally rarefied  
By weighing forsaken denarii;  
It’s tenfold more ethical  
Leftward for decimals  
(Any defaulter can verify).  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 10:30-37  
  
A Levite despoiled by murderers  
Is spurned by his erstwhile co-worshippers.  
A hated Samaritan  
Deigns to take care of him:  
Neighborhood's curious curvature.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 11:5-8  
  
If neighbors esteem your exhorting  
For dinner at one in the morning  
Insufficient inducement,  
Continue your nuisance;  
Aversion defers to extorting.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 11:11-13  
  
Will a father besought for a sturgeon  
Provision his son with a serpent?  
Nor could he apportion  
A pitiless scorpion  
In answer to innocent urgence.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 11:21-22  
  
A warrior’s martial equivalents  
Dismantle his panoplied vigilance.  
Bereft of his weapons,  
He renders possession  
To weaklings abusing his impotence.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 12:16-20  
  
Proprietors tout the allowance  
Attending increasing endowments,  
Inanely complacent  
As eager assailants  
Contrive their eternal impoundment.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 14:8-11  
  
At banquet, celebrity softens  
Respect for convivial commons.  
Correctively placed  
Is roundly disgraced,  
Unless you begin at the bottom.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 14:12-14  
  
Exclusively spreading your larder  
For peers is circuitous barter.  
Munificent deeds  
Remediate need,  
Disclaiming the services garnered.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 14:28-30  
  
Consider your sponsorship powers  
Discreetly; constructing a tower  
Encourages gossips,  
Who scoff a colossus  
Conspicuously unembowered.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 14:31-32  
  
A savvy commander researches  
If everyone’s soldiers concerted  
Meet tactical cogency,  
Whether diplomacy  
Carries the balance of courage.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 14:34-35  
  
If seasoning’s flavor’s erased,  
What spices rekindle its taste?  
But salt without savor’s  
Fit neither for nature  
Nor churning the secular waste.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 15:4-6  
  
A fitly assiduous shepherd  
Will rescue a single defector,  
Whose ninety-nine fellows,  
Behind in the meadow,  
Are only beseiged by conjectures.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 15:8-9  
  
Although silver pieces are formally  
Denominated for conformity  
As desiderata,  
A vanishing drachma  
Acquires de facto priority.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 15:11-32  
  
Between qualifying descendants,  
Protracting domestic attendance  
Is uneconomical:  
Only the prodigal  
Reaps dividends from repentance.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 16:1-9  
  
The shrewdly audacious embezzler  
Auditions his master’s successor  
By cooking accounts;  
Remitted amounts  
Reflect the felonious ledger.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Luke 18:2-5  
  
The widow petitions the arbiter  
To wield his position to pardon her.  
Afraid of sustaining  
Her fiercest inveighing,  
He makes the haranguer a harbinger.  
  
  
### Second Timothy 2:20-21  
  
Your villa is riddled with vessels  
Extravagant and excremental.  
Through earnest ablutions  
Performed in pollution,  
Distinctions are inconsequential.  
  
  
### The Gospel of John 2:10  
  
Cascades of immaculate tipple  
Subside with the slackening trickle  
Of guests still undoused,  
But only the soused  
Make profligacy sacrificial.  
  
  
### The Gospel of John 12:24-25  
  
Survival’s forsaking your peers’  
Subsistence affixed to the ears;  
Terrestrial furrows’  
Funereal burrows  
Are uncultivated frontiers.  
  
  
### The Epistle of James 1:23-24  
  
Discernment’s progressively clearer  
For spectators traveling nearer,  
But only a creature  
Discovers its features  
Anew on approaching a mirror.  
  
  
### The Epistle to the Hebrews 9:16-17  
  
Determining whether a testament’s  
Acquitted is strictly an estimate  
If its architect  
Can ever defect:  
His extermination’s prerequisite.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 3  
  
Who seeks uninhabited skies,  
Which birds have forever belied,  
Moreover imagines  
The nethermost fathoms  
Bereft of their wriggling fry.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 7  
  
If humans’ predation enlightens  
Grotesquely carnivorous lions,  
Then Lion bedamns  
Comestible Man,  
Whose stomach’s the moral horizon.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 21  
  
Adults are naively remorseless  
Annexing a juvenile fortress.  
Debunkers dislodge  
Embroidered facades,  
But blithely relinquish the corpus.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 32  
  
Estates overtopping their pinnacles  
Make fortification formidable  
Where altitudes rise  
Unparalleleized,  
Ascending inversely-invisible.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 60  
  
The annual supplicant gorges  
On nature’s insipid resources,  
Whose paramount cookery’s  
Grounded in butchery—  
Tailoring derelict corpses.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 97  
  
An urn with immoderate plenty  
For burden weighs comparably gently,  
Concealing the fickle  
Interior’s trickle  
Until it’s entirely empty.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 98  
  
A freshly-aspiring assassin,  
Awaiting his first liquefaction,  
Stilettos the wall  
To better recall  
His accuracy and dispassion.  
  
  
### The Gospel of Thomas 102  
  
The ox is an excellent eater,  
Unless opportunity’s meager:  
A dog in the trough  
Is blocking enough  
For both, but allotting to neither.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Man. 5.1.5  
  
Pure wormwood adulterates nectar.  
Evoked from the slenderest vector,  
Concocting a stagnant,  
Dispirited absinthe,  
The worst realizes the lesser.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Man. 11.1.15  
  
The singular empty carafe  
Won’t fill on another’s behalf;  
Though craftily left  
Beside, it’s bereft  
Of any gratuitous draughts.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Man. 11.1.20  
  
A bit of itinerant hail  
Attains an impulse to impale.  
Perennial drops  
Disintegrate rocks;  
Celestial jetsam prevails.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Sim. 2.1.3  
  
Abundance erupts from the vine  
Wherever its tendrils entwine  
The vertical elm,  
Whose limbs underwhelm  
Before that precipitous climb.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Sim. 3.1.3  
  
Until the survivors awaken,  
The woods are autumnally chastened.  
Deserted expanses  
Delineate branches  
Above camouflaged hibernations.  
  
  
### The Shepherd of Hermas Sim. 5.2.1-11  
  
A slave both obligingly plotting  
The requisite margins and opting  
To pledgelessly weed,  
Once rightfully freed,  
Is eligible for adopting.
