*In the bell-ringing sequence of the Prague astronomical clock*

I  
am  
not  
made  
but am  
I of old  
fact set  
or I am one  
with any if  
I of the dark  
sea am I of sun  
beam for an I of  
one star too am I  
in two more and so  
I do not move but as  
I am put down for an I  
in new time not as I in  
the past was or I as yet  
come can be I am let slow  
now as I up the lone eon to  
I on far brim aim an I of dim  
gaze but on I as shy fate has  
of I no die cast but as I in any  
wise ask or I in raw fear let be
